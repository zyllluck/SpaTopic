Description: SpaTopic, a versatile statistical learning framework that harmonizes 
    spatial clustering and cell-type deconvolution by integrating single-cell 
    transcriptomics and SRT data. Through topic modelling of cell-type contributions 
    across spatial domains, SpaTopic allows for stratification of the TME into 
    spatial domains with coherent cellular organization, and thus facilitates 
    the refined annotation of spatial architecture with improved performance.
